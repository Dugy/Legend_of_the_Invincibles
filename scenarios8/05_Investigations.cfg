Somewhere behind the barren lands, the journey usually takes our caravans something more than a month, but recently, many of our caravans directed there have been waylaid. Survivors mentioned escaping terrible horned humanoid monsters, as strong as three men. We have employed several new caravans now, and they are really fantastic, no attacks from the monsters, doing it twice as fast as normal caravans. It was time to kick the old corrupted caravans and get new ones..."

They are roaming the lands freely, but avoiding fights with civilisation, because they are not numerous enough yet. They are using infiltrators instead, and it seems that these infiltrators are also earning gold to gain civil power. Anyway, you have just given my daughter to the demons."
