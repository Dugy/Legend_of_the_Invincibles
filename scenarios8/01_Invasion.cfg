They decided to bring up the children outside large cities, because it was expectable that their son and the baby girl created by Queen of Darkness would be much stronger than other kinds, and the risk of becoming bullies was present. They moved their army into several nearby fortresses to protect them, spread spells inhibiting the aging process, and their son was born. They named him Krux, after his grandfather. The little girl had no name, so Lethalia named her Vritra. Lethalia never explained why she gave her that name, only kept saying that it is a riddle for everyone."
