And in all places they could see the terrible toll Fimbulwinter took on life: bodies, frozen to death.

After several days' travel through a wintry landscape, they found an oasis that seemed quite out of place. For some reason the vital forces of Light were still prevailing there, repelling the frost â€“ however unable to save its inhabitants from the black souls. The heroes decided to stay and take a short respite. Yet, all the time they felt more and more of those dark, eerie hunters gathering nearby..."

He saved me from them, I was cornered, with only a few soldiers. I accompanied him, planning to flee once we get back to places I know. He approached a small camp of demons. In fact, other disguised demons. The did not know about the theatre they played in my empire, so they just mocked me and imprisoned me, planning to torture me for pleasure. The truth was obvious, the Lords of Twilight were just demons disguised for infiltration."

Well, I started accompanying him in his campaign to clear the empire from the demons, but we failed when we realised that they were far too numerous. Then you defeated Uria, they weakened and we won the battle. But then the demons decided to take their revenge by releasing the black souls."
