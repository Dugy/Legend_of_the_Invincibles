The known truth is that the mountains, valleys and clean lakes of this land strike the immortal with such awe, that he could even allow himself the fantasy of being truly alive once more and able to feel the scent of the green grass, the coolness of the breeze, the invigorating touch of fresh water down his throat.
This dream could not be given much time, however, for evil had to be dealt with once more."

They are also weakened by daylight, much more than any creatures of the night would be. Furthermore, they can infect others with their own power simply by attacking them. It is similar to the undead plague, but I... know... some necromancy... and it is very different.
The only other possibility that comes to mind is a mythical being I have read about somewhere long ago, in a tome of dark lore: the vampire. A dark creature capable of turning others into their likeness and that drinks blood as food."
