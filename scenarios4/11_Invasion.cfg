The others probably wanted the humans to deal with the undead hordes, and let them pass only to save themselves from a lot of trouble."

And Krux was a natural seducer. Yes, a fine-looking fellow and a fencer, able to beguile any woman. I emanated from a love that lasted for a single day. But my mother never forgot prince charming... Well, my father was reckless but not headless, perhaps he feared I could become his enemy one day. So he visited us from time to time, despite the discomforts of a several-day travel from his town. No, I do not like talking about your parents. They both died before I met you. Mother died from a disease, father was executed in another town, where he fled after a rebellion against his family took place in his hometown. Together, we never had enough time to chat about our lives before the darkness came upon us. And then all my feelings were gone, the memories became unimportant. And now, it is just ancient history.
