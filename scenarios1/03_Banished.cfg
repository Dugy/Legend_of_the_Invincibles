While it could turn out all right, I feel we need to check on them just to make sure. The elves' numbers are very limited, so if they did become targeted by the orcs, they would be in big trouble. Also, best we do not harm the trees, the elves are said to despise it. No campfires from here on out, they won't be worth it if we wind up earning the ire of the elves on top of our homeland."
