They were kept in different dungeons, but still Lethalia's magic was capable of freeing her hands and her budding ability to fly posed a great threat to them. At first a party of eight Orcish Warlords were sent to guard them until the Orcish council decided on an appropriate public, humiliating death for them. But, as the orcs fought constantly, power changed hands several times, and soon the prisoners were almost forgotten."
