So we know which incantations we must do with our last breaths. But there are greater threats. First, we will be stone cold, so anyone who touches us will know immediately we are undead. Second, we must hide our undead army somewhere."

The third problem is that the poison will make us die while unconscious. You are better at necromancy than me. What do you suggest?"

        [part]
            story= _ "Efraim:
The problem with heat may be solved by bounding more spirits into our bodies, - possibly later, after becoming liches. Our spirits will think and use magic, while the others shall heat and heal us, and provide more magical power to our souls. But we do risk them overcoming us... And about the second problem, I think we will be enough powerful to kill enough enemies at the beginning of each battle to raise an undead army at the place."

            story= _ "Efraim:
The problem with unconsciousness can be solved by dying from something else, that would not damage our body, like suffocation or another, fast acting poison. And we have to hurry, I can feel that we are close to death."

        [part]
            story= _ "Lethalia:
I know. I have never been so ill before. Your ideas are great. I think that we should kill ourselves by drinking the rest of the poison to make sure we do not rot and if the poison will not act fast, we will have to drown because strangling may cause wounds. I know nothing about the healing power of the spirits, but I think that liches do not keep every wound they receive."

            story= _ "Lethalia:
So I think that the spirits will remember some sort of original form of the body, because in other cases liches would look like humans. No... Their original form was also fleshy. Rotting is a natural process, while wounds are not. That is it. But I cannot say whether these wounds shall remain. We cannot risk it."

        [part]
            story= _ "Efraim:
Probably you are right. When our health becomes very weak, we shall drink the rest of poison and tell someone strong to drown us. And to put a heavy stone on us, because it is not clear whether or not other spirits will prevail."

            story= _ "Their end arrived in a month's time. They were so weak that they had problems to speak. Only Lethalia's magic kept them conscious. So they drank a huge dose of the poison and because it did not act fast, they told a strong elf to drown them, while the others put heavy boulders on them. Efraim was saying the last words of the incantation soundlessly in his mind."
