If you defeat her in combat and they see her head falling, it will shatter their faith completely. But to slay her material form is very hard to accomplish. It would not be organic in this world, made instead of the same substance thought and souls are made of, so it will be more a battle of minds than one of swords and arrows. I see no other way. With elvish souls feeding her, she may just grow strong enough to conquer the whole continent and materialise then to rule over all that is life. It mustn't be allowed!"
