She took it first, and after that I watched how it was piercing her body and doing unimaginable horrible things with her, she stood up, bleeding heavily, and attacked me. She used the tentacles to disarm me and mauled me almost to death. Later, I was repaired and imprisoned."		# Kind of an easter egg - Akula's hair does not look as she ever did something to it except (occasional) cleaning
