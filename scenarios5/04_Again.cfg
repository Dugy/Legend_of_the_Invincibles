        {AGAIN_REPLY _"Efraim:
Where did you hide those notes how they created the second sun? That mage, Taruk, found it. I had never heard of him before, so he is definitely no prodigy."}
        {AGAIN_REPLY _"Lethalia:
I have hidden it really carefully. It was hidden in a dimension I created only because of it, behind a secret portal only undead elves can enter. There was no other way to get there, because it was the portal itself that created it when you tried to enter."}
        {AGAIN_REPLY _"Efraim:
So what if he had an undead elf ally? That is not so impossible. There are surely also some elvish liches. When you see a lich, you cannot tell if it is a human or elf or orc. But why would that lich do that for him? Hm, probably he was just offered a reward and he had no idea what was there."}
        {AGAIN_REPLY _"Lethalia:
It was not so easy. The portal was in a deep cave, inside the world of my mind, and also well-hidden. There was no way somebody could locate it there."}
        {AGAIN_REPLY _"Efraim:
Maybe some complex magic methods might be able to find such things. And also it should be possible to create a portal there without having to read such books as Gateways, just from more basic things you have not censored."}
        {AGAIN_REPLY _"Lethalia:
I agree. But it would require a really exquisite mind to do that. And these two things are there just to make sure that nobody will steal or damage it. It is magically encrypted. They cannot read a word from it if it is not placed inside the decryption showcase, and reading it there requires a passphrase. The passphrase is just a senseless group of letters I remember, and the decryption showcase itself offers no clue about the passphrase. There is absolutely no way to tell what the passphrase is. All they can do is to try the possibilities, or get lucky. In both cases, it is not very likely to happen before a million of years pass."}
        {AGAIN_REPLY _"Efraim:
This stinks with betrayal. We will have to find that mage as soon as possible."}
        {AGAIN_REPLY _"Lethalia:
... ... ...he is in Dan'Tonk. He is not even trying to hide from searching spells."}
        {AGAIN_REPLY _"Efraim:
Before the town, we will leave our army with Akula and we will enter the town. I know we are the most wanted ones at the moment, but we can... hide in the shadows."}
