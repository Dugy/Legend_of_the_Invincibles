Thus, king Dantair was made painfully aware that his biggest enemies were those who insisted in the necessity to create an additional sun. The cruel reality that the true purpose was the ruin of the kingdom and that they were having their eye on the crown for themselves made him quickly revoke his earlier royal decree: There was no longer need for a third shiner in the sky."
