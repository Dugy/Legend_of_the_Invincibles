Maybe they took the warning into consideration, maybe they just were too lazy to make it shine like the sun through the whole spectrum. Anyway, the heating effects of the visible light it emitted like the regular sun were still strong enough to change the climate. Northlands became much more fertile. The central land started to wither. Thunderstorms raged way too frequently near the shores. Southern lands were overgrown by thick jungles, full of dangerous creatures."
