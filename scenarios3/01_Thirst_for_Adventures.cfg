These special units also have the <i>loyal</i> attribute and advance slightly faster.

(While it is possible to recall units from previous campaigns, this is not recommended as you will have to pay upkeep for them and, as mentioned above, there are many scenarios that you start without a keep.)"

They have proved too quick and agile for my men, who find the forest hard to traverse. The bandits' headquarters are west of here in an old and abandoned castle. If you are able to vanquish them, you will have my elite guard at your disposal! Although not as agile as your elves, my men are much more hardy and would be of inestimable value against tougher foes."
