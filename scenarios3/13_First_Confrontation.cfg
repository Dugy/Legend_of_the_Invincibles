            story= _ "Lethalia:
If we defeat the dragons, the Wesnothian Empire will have a golden era, whose mages will erect a second sun. But we already know that a second sun will come to be in the sky. It will banish the night and evil, but completely modify the weather and transform the country to withered desert. But as the rise of two suns may be only in an impossibly distant future, the golden era of Wesnoth may be also impossibly distant. If we rename Wesnoth, the time when some country gets a name Wesnoth, may become pretty distant. Wesnoth comes from Northwest, and it has no logic nowadays. Midland is a much better name. Such a decision requires a royal decree. Now, who better to ask for this petty favour than our king's overambitious consort? Young Asheviere is already out to seize power, we shall help her to mount the throne, and one hand washes the other. Tyrants like destroying the past."
