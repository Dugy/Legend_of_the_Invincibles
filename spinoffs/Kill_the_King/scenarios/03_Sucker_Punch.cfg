            story= _ "After another musically and martially rewarding success of Sabotäge in Traphampton, the royal office withdrew its soldiers from the lands they visited from time to time, making them relatively free to do what they wanted. They had to keep traveling to make sure they would not be forgotten and keep the opportunistic tax collectors away. It was clear that Weldyn sent these leeches to lurk around and force them to return to old places a lot, slowing down their expansion."

            story= _ "It was also clear the defeated, humiliated generals were looking for a way to put them down. Military confrontation turned out to be ineffective, but were they some other ways? The royal office was forced to think hard instead of using brute force. Easier said than done, they were not doing it very fast, clearly because of their ineffectiveness."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "Meanwhile, the popularity of Sabotäge grew so much that some people imitated them, creating small bands on their own. They welcomed these rookies and helped them start their projects, enchanting their instruments and such. They were not in competition, they just did their work."
