            story= _ "They made a beautiful ghost out of Lovelia, she lost a bit of her self, but the result was much more obedient. She joined the ranks of their undead army. With the main threat to their endeavour immortalised in the right way, they made a few shows to get back the attention and awaken people who were enchanted by their former adversary. Then, Aarron's girlfriend arrived."

        [part]
            story= _ "She came with style, kicking Mortimer somewhere where his belly should have been if he was not a ghost. When asked what nickname she wanted, she suggested to call her Lethargia. Strigo complained that lethargy was not exactly what they wanted to cause in people, so she named herself Slayerina. They had no time to teach her to play some instrument, so she just enchanted her staff so that it would make her voice sound louder."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "They asked her to dress quite revealingly to regain attention of some of the people who zealously worshipped Lovelia and thought she would return sometime (Strigo's idea to show them the zombie that left from her was not accepted). It did not work perfectly and was making Slayerina quite upset, but it helped a lot. Because they knew that the royal force is really weak, they prepared for an invasion towards Weldyn when their power base was secured. All they needed was to get attention from the locals before the attack."
