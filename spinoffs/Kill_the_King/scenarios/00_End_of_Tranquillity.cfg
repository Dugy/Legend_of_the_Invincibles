            story= _ "The Black Tavern is famous for its darkly tranquil atmosphere. Loud arguments are rare, brawls even rarer and that almost everyone knows that guards do never visit. It would seem to be the dream of any bartender, but the reason for its peaceful mood is that common pub goers are afraid to visit it. Rumours are going around that Calcy, the bard who always sings there, is a skeleton whose gravely voice adds to the glum tone, that many of the patrons are walking dead and that it is the regular haunt where necromancers would have a drink together."

            story= _ "Today's visitors would scare off even the most of vicious tavern brawlers, but in the Black Tavern they were nothing unusual. One called himself Mortimer, a man completely wrapped in black clothing, even wearing a mask. It could be felt that it didn't serve to hide a disfigured face... Actually, he was a wraith who had to cover up his transparency. Another one was known as Strigo, a vampire quaffing blood from his mug instead of ale.  And there was Aarron, or so he said. This guy had no clear marks of inhumanity, but his ability to pass for a human made him the scariest."
