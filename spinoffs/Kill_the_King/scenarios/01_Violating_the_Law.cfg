They also trained themselves in basics of axe combat so that they would be able to react if ambushed while performing. Eventually, they decided that they were ready for playing before a different audience than a few rangers they encountered in the forest where they practised."

            story= _ "They used a few spells to disguise Calcy to be harder to distinguish from a human and made their debut in a small hicksville tavern. Most peasants fled in terror, but some remained and enjoyed the show. They repeated the outing a couple of times and their audience slowly grew. They performed in some other pubs nearby. Some people followed them, increasing the profit of any village inn where they played. They persuaded bartenders to reduce the prices in the concert nights and the cheaper ale attracted more visitors to their shows."

            story= _ "They were surprised that no guards tried to stop them, but they did not complain. After a dozen shows, their audience grew and had issues fitting into a usual tavern, so they decided to play in The Huge Tavern, the shebeen around."
