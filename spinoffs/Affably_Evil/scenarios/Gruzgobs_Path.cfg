He must have passed through Ogira before, for which I could not find any evidence, but considering the rarity of orcish attacks in these parts, it could have been very long ago. Or Gruzgob was as sneaky as a cat and passed around without being noticed, so that he could take over the less fortified Amaranth and attack Ogira from multiple directions then."
