It was quite easy, we ceased to lend them more gold a few years earlier and their soldiers were not sufficiently paid and had no loyalty."

It did not earn gold in any way, its way of operation was to assume that it will usually take long until gold is withdrawn and those few who do withdraw it will not withdraw too much. We stole great amounts of gold from Ponzi Bank, until a war started and a few noblemen needed to withdraw great amounts of gold from it. We did not have the gold. Because of the interest rate, the amount it pretended they have was really huge."
