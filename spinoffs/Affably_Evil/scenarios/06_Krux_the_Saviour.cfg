Maybe in the elvish community they hide their ears under their hair, bleach their hair and pretend that they are a bit short and bulky but still elves. I have seen elves that could be mistaken for humans if they wore a full helmet hiding also their hair. I guess that she might pretend that her daughter is pure blooded, although it would require some effort."
