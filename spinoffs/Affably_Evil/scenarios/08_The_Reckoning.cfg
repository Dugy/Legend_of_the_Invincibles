It was a part of a side project, so, unfortunately, it is not perfect, but still, being able to become a ghost and living a relatively normal life afterwards might be a great achievement. However, my test subject cannot remember anything from past life, though it appears to be rather from the horror of being killed than from the undeath itself. Furthermore, it fled after some time, I am unused to the free will of my test subjects. I will need more precautions next time. I might use this technique on me if everything else fails, but being a ghost and masking myself as a human might not be easy, because ghosts are transparent. I will need to make them more corporeal."

It has destroyed many undead, probably those who had seen it. It appears to have a decent control of magic, because it keeps eluding my attempts to detect it. I am suspecting that it was Lucretia, my first successful experiment at making a ghost that retains its former self who had fled from me. I wonder what she wants, she is immortal and I have nothing else to give."
