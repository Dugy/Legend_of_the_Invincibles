            message=_"She is a formidable enemy. She can handle many powerful opponents at once, face large armies alone because she will drain more energy from the weak than she spends. But that is not the biggest problem. She can possess most humans except the most strong-minded, though only one person can be possessed at once. When possessing someone, she can make her host use all spells and combat tricks she can use. People possessed by her are as dangerous as herself and it can be anybody."

            message=_"As a result, it happens that various rulers, warlords or arch mages suddenly become hosts of the Queen of Darkness. Possession is nothing hard for her, so she can easily gain any position she desires. A drawback is that she does not inherit the behavioural traits of her hosts, so she can be identified if the possession is not prepared correctly. It happened that a queen recognised that her husband suddenly became less violent and it was discovered that he was possessed."

It is possible that she is using a magical disguise and looks differently."

It usually starts when she possesses an important person, usually somebody who is not known well by his surroundings. To enhance her social powers, she uses assassinations, possessions of others, terror, false enemies, pretended love or even the fear her name causes. Armed with her wit, magical power and experience, the person becomes far more important than before and tries to become a permanent tyrant, her ultimate goal."

Later, she helped our gods to fight demons and Lilith, claiming that the world must exist if she wants to rule it. It is not known why our god did not leave his evil part, but some people fear that this hypothetical King of Darkness might come one day."
