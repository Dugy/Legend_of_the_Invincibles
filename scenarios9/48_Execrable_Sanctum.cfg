It was nearly revealed when you discovered that I had taken a poison that drained my powers, but you supposed that some assassins poisoned me; I took it to conceal my real power, I could cure myself really fast if the situation went really bad. So I led you here, and... learned your power. Now, I need to continue the play, to be on the side of the winners."
