Don't recall too many elves, they are too slow in caves. Get into the central cave, defeat the troll leader, then fight your way through the undead, the target location is at the eastern border, a bit south from the centre. Try to advance the unique Skeletal Dragon, he may get a breath attack and better damages for example."

Recruit or recall a lot, and choose units that can counter the enemies you see (heavily defensive, not particularly offensive, prepare for their peculiar damage types and exploit their additional weakness to fire and impact). Try to destroy quickly as many enemies as possible, before you end up facing a horde of them. Then, it will be a <i>slow</i> battle, you might find it useful to pull slowed units away from combat to let them unfreeze before rejoining the batle. Beware of the Yetis that can be dangerous in combination with the other opponents. If possible, kill the leader even if it doesn't win the scenario, his super mass slow and income can cause further trouble."

Approach the lake and undead will pop up. Once an undead attacks one of your units, Efraim will enchant him: they will join forces with your team and won't bother you anymore. – Defeat the remaining two leaders, one of them might be defeated by the undead if you give them a little help.

To approach the mage more easily, there are some alleys where you can hide. If a solitary guard stands in your way and there are no others around, you may slay him without worries.

In the second phase, just deal as much damage to the main enemy as possible, and try to avoid damaging other units - they are yours, and will be yours again once the enemy is dead. Be careful, she causes quite severe ranged damage and can inflict some damage back when hit in melee. If you can, use two ranged attacks to first slow and then to injure her."

You might discover several secret locations that aren't visible on the map which usually contain something useful. In one of them, you will find Akula's sister, a clone of the unit you met at the start of this chapter. In another place, you will find some dwarves fighting the same enemies as you and they will help you in the final battle. There is also a hidden library where you will discover a secret."

There are lots of enemies, so you might want to use Lavaflow to create narrower places to fight them more safely. All you have to do is to pass through them, but it is very useful to defeat all enemy leaders in the process.

Then storm the central location. You will encounter the enemy boss here, she has extra HP, damage when getting hit and regular damage for each amplificator you left operational. I suggest to use Soulgate a lot of times, then return into the Guardian room to recharge it, use it again, and repeat this procedure until you have all the units you need on your recall list. Then you may attack the main enemy. You should activate the Ancient Warriors by choosing the last option at the monolith (Google might help you to figure out the meaning of this sentences).

The enemy boss will be easy to defeat if you have destroyed all the amplificators, otherwise just have attack her, this scenario is the last of this part anyway. You cannot continue to the next chapter. Watch why after having defeated the boss"

The molten magma will burst through its banks, flooding the area, destroying everything on its way. Avoid leaving units near the expanding lava at all costs, it deals huge damage and your units will get trapped if there is no walkable hex near them. Pick a random path, and head southeast. Almost all tracks lead southeast, find a safe route and watch out for all the chambers with hidden treasures. Admittedly, looting them is greatly dangerous because of the extending lava. You can split up, but be careful, the undead might become annoying, especially if the lava is near and you cannot move around while fighting."

Also use scouts to learn what is around you, and attack nightmares (you will quickly learn what they are) as soon they come in sight to make sure they will not kill some of your units first. When a snow storm comes, try to get into a cave. Caves are usually not large enough for your entire army, so you might either split up or build some igloos. Fighting during a snowstorm isn't a really bad idea, with enough healers' support and cold resistance, it can be survived, and enemies will deal much less damage (especially during daytime). You may use the 'teleport units to Efraim' trick to get through hard terrains (if Efraim has improved his movement and obtained levitation, this will be even more effective). At any spot you also can build a keep to call for backup. The target is at the top edge, a bit west of the centre of the map: get into the cave on that ice floe connected with the snow-covered plains."

 - in the Chambers of Oblivion (below the Island of Atrocity in the northwest)

 - Stronghold of Tears
 - Twilit Fortress

Resistance gains from armours increase the ability to cope with being attacked in a specific way: A unit whose physical resistances have been increased by X% will suffer X% less damage than a unit without armour. Example: An unarmoured Fencer bears 130% of blade damage. With two pieces of armour – one increasing resistances by 20%, one adding 10% – he will suffer 130 * (100 - 20) * (100 - 10) = 93.6 % of the damage he would take if he was unprotected, equivalent to a 7% blade resistance. This applies to any unit – no matter how much armour it is already wearing. Naturally, it requires extremely powerful items to obtain extremely high resistances. Note that only half of the set percentage applies to resistance to impact: blunt weapons were always used to bash through armours."

A unit outfitted with items shows the trait 'GEARED' to easily detect it on the recall list. There are also small images of armours, weapons or red orbs next to them to identify them as 'not the most expendable soldiers'.

Spells gained have huge ranges, incomparable to other spells, and converge into Particle storm, an attack hitting many enemies and dealing severe arcane damage. Physical abilities converge into Spiritual Transformation, that is an attack that makes the unit attack a single target with huge damage and taking only 33% of the damage.
