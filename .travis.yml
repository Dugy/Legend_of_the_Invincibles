# wmllint (part of Wesnoth itself) is a static analyzer of WML files.

# so for now its warnings shouldn't cause Travis build to fail.
# Note: temporarily disabled: takes too long to run, and its output is not very useful until we suppress/fix
# existing warnings (especially false positives), as those warnings make it almost impossible to notice real errors in the log.
