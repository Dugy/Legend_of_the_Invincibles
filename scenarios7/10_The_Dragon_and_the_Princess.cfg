The horse rider's hair turned blond. His gender changed. The body I was possessing became an identical copy of my body in a few days. And in a month, it decayed and died."

She also looked very similar to me. I possessed her. In a few days, I realised that her appearance was changing as well, and she decayed and died, but this one survived for longer."

Without it, any body I take will die quickly. Because I am the same person as your companion, I had access to the vial with the poison. I took some of it, and started poisoning a new candidate, similar to the previous one. When she was close to death, I possessed her and performed the same ritual as before. By the time when she was transformed to my shape, but before she started to decay. I had to use potent magic to bend the minds of a few people to assist me, but everything went without issues. Being undead is not a great victory, so I hope I will manage to figure out something better."
